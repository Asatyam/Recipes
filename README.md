# Recipes
This is a very basic website which will contain some basic html elements

In this website I will try to incorporate the following html elements. Keep in 
mind that this is a pure html project so it will not contain any CSS or JS.

- p
- h1, h2, etc
- img
- strong, em

In this project, there is one homepage which contains an image and links to the recipes. The links take you to the page of the recipe which contain image, its description, the ingredients and finally, the steps to prepare the dish.
